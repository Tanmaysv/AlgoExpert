Recursive algorithms will take 0(n) space as it adds function on call stack until all the execution is completed.

Tail Recursion:
When recursion function call is the last line of code then its called tail recursion.
Some compilers optimized tail recursion code to just take O(1) space as they will replace the result of the
last function call with the latest function call. In interview just mention that recursive algorithm do take
O(n) space which can be avoided though not by all compilers to O(1) space by using tail recursion.
Some compilers can optimize your normal recursion to just take constant space but dont know how reliable or which
compilers do that
