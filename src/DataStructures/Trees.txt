Each node in a tree will have only parent.
If it has more than one parent then it will become graph
Tree will have no cycle and nodes will not be disconnected

Ternary tree: Every node has at most 3 child nodes.

k-ary tree: Every node has at most k child nodes.

Tries - Special type of tree which allows to store characters as nodes

In trees you can have pointers from child node to parent node.
Most trees don't have this property but you should note that this is possible

Complete k-ary tree: when all nodes are filled except last node and the last node is filled form left to right
Full k-ary tree: where each node except last has either no children or k children
Perfect k-ary tree: where all leaves has same depth. You can also say that each level is completely filled
