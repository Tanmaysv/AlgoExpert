User logs in, we will send an api request to fetch the products from products table

Product
ID, PROD_NAME, QTY, PRICE

User can then search for any products. When user types 3 characters we can send api to fetch products only
that matches the search. If the products is not avilable we show that.

User can then add any product to the cart. We can store that info in memory.

Once user clicks on checkout, we will update the products table put a lock till update is complete.
