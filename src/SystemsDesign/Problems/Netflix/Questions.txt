1) What features would you like me to build for this system. Just the video streaming or things like
recommendation and payment features etc ?
2) Is this a global application supported across multiple regions ?
3) Number of concurrent users that can use the app and that can view the same video ?
4) Max latency allowed ?
5) When we discuss about content what kind of data are we discussing just the video or images as well ?
6) Should the system be highly available ?
7) Do we also need to think about acl's and route say users who havent payed the subscription to see
different content ?
8) If user in the middle of watching a video, clicks the back button, do we need to think about
cancelling api call ?
