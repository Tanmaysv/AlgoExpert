1) What would be the scope of this system. Just fetching the news ?
2) Highly available ?
3) Number of concurrent users ?
4) Number of regions ?
5) Does the system has the concept of following people and then if news is posted by that people/group
others would be able to see it ? If thats the case is there any limit of max users a particular group
can have ?
6) Acceptable latency ?
7) Does the system have payment feature ?
8) Once someone has posted a news does it have to be instantly available to users accross region or
some latency is allowed ?
9) Do we have to think about recommendation system which would be shown when user logs in ?
10) Does liking/sharing a post needs to have strong consistency ?
