1) What features are we looking to build in this system ? Just content upload which can be viewed by
other people or more ?
2) Is it a global application ?
3) Number of concurrent users that can view a google drive location ?
4) The max content size a user can upload at a particular drive location ?
5) Max latency allowed ?
6) What kind of content should we think about just text or image etc as well ?
7) Highly available ?
8) Once a file is uploaded do we want it to be auto available to users who are already
in that location or do they need to refresh to get the uploaded file ?
9) Can a user delete the uploaded file as well ?
10) Do we need to think about feature wherein a users authorization gets expired and they no longer
can view the content ?
