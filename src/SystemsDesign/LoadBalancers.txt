DNS Round Robin: Is a type of LB, wherein a DNS name has multiple IP address associated with that name
which is distributed in round robin manner when query requests come in. If you run dig google.com multiple times
you will get different IP address each time

Different LB's:
1) Software LB: You can do more in terms customizing/coding based on the requirement than hardware LB
2) Hardware LB

Ways to load balance i.e. select servers:
1) Random
2) Round robin: gurantee even distribution
3) Weighted round robin: can traffic more request to server with higher weight
4) LBalance based on performance: Performs health check and if one of the server is not performing well, then
that LB will not or reduce traffic there
5) IP based: Hash client request and say hash number is 1, then route it to server number 1. This can be used
when you are using caching, so that every time a particular client makes a request, it goes to the same server
where response is cached for that particular client.
6) Path based: Requests related to particular feature will be routed to a particular server(s). For instance
request related to payment can be routed to particular sets of servers and related to code execution
can be routed to different set of servers. eg algoexpert. useful when code deployment of a particular service

You can have multiple load balancers with different server selection strategies
If your load balancer starts getting overloaded you can have multiple load balancer talking to each other
