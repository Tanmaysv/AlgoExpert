There are 2 types of proxy
1) Forward Proxy: Sits between client and proxy. Request goes from client to proxy and to server.
Response goes from server to proxy to client. Source IP address is hidden and replaced by proxy address.
Forward proxy is more of a client side proxy meaning the server does not know that request is coming from proxy.
It thinks the client is sending a request.
eg: VPN on the browser

2) Reverse Proxy: More of a server proxy which means when client sends a request, the request goes to the proxy,
but the client does not know that because its configured on the server side. The client thinks the request is
going to server.
Uses of reverse proxy:
a) You can filter out requests you dont want to go to the server
b) Reverse proxy can log stuffs for you. Log metrics etc.
c) Cache some html pages, so less load on the server
d) Best use case -> use as load balancer (look at load balancer txt file for info)
